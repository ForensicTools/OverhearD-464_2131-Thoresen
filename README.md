Project Overheard
===========================

The overhear daemon is a tool that will proactively keep track of hosts on your local area network. The daemon will alert you if a host appears to have its network interface card (NIC) in promiscuous mode. As hosts on your network enter and exit promiscuous mode, the overhear daemon (overheard) will generate alerts and log separate events.

While this is extremely useful, what we really need is a tool that is always listening, always conducting tests, and always keeping track of hosts.

A hacker who has successfully managed to social engineer his/her way into the building of a corperate/government entity, has just connected their laptop to the local network.
